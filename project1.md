## [Improved Airflip Product Messaging](https://www.airflip.com/) 
- **Refined Messaging:** Conducted competitive analysis and applied a messaging framework to articulate Airflip's key benefits. By working backwards from personas, I aligned messaging with user needs, highlighting the most impactful features to solve their pain points effectively.
- **Engaging Visuals:** Created step-by-step workflow videos and animations using Screen Studio to simplify complex features, making them more accessible and visually compelling.
- **Optimized Call-to-Actions:** Enhanced CTAs through revised text, strategic placement, and visual design improvements, driving higher user engagement and conversion rates.

## [Created Comprehensive and Accessible Documentation](https://help.airflip.com/product-guide/spend-analytics-dashboard)
- **Robust Help Center:** Designed an intuitive documentation site using Mintlify. It includes detailed product guides, terminology definitions, and user-centric content tailored to resolve common pain points.
- **Seamless Integration:** Linked documentation directly to platform features, allowing users to access relevant guidance in real-time without leaving the product.
