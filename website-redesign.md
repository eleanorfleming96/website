title: Website & Documentation Redesign
---
>I led [Airflip's](https://www.airflip.com){:target="_blank"} website redesign in August 2024 to improve how we communicated our value proposition to users. The new design boosted engagement by 15%, increased demo requests and reduced customer support inquiries.

## Improved Airflip Product Messaging

    <div style="text-align: left; width: 1100px;">
        <img src="/public/images/website.gif" alt="website" width="100%"/>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

- **Refined Messaging:** Conducted competitive analysis and applied a messaging framework to articulate Airflip's key benefits. By working backwards from personas, I aligned messaging with user needs, highlighting the most impactful features to solve their pain points effectively.
- **Engaging Visuals:** Created step-by-step workflow videos and animations using Screen Studio to simplify complex features, making them more accessible and visually compelling.
- **Optimized Call-to-Actions:** Enhanced CTAs through revised text, strategic placement, and visual design improvements, driving higher user engagement and conversion rates.


## Created Comprehensive Documentation

- **[Robust Help Center](https://www.airflip.com/help){:target="_blank"}** Designed an intuitive documentation site using Mintlify. It includes detailed product guides, terminology definitions, and user-centric content tailored to resolve common pain points.
- **Seamless Integration:** Linked documentation directly to platform features, allowing users to access relevant guidance in real-time without leaving the product.
